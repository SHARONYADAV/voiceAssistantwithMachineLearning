# voiceAssistantwithMachineLearning

I have made a voice assistant using python and added machine learning modules in it.
1) voice assistant does image classification when you ask her to show pictures. you just have to speak what category pictures you want from a folder and it just shows those pictures.
2) Second if you want to see any file of extension you have to say open document and it just ask which drive and then tell drive name it will open that for you.
